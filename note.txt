onCreate*(
The method that is called when the activity is first created and the ideal location for most initializtion tasks to be performed
the method is passed an argument in the form of a Bundle objetc that may contain dynamic state informaion (typiclly relating to the state of the user interface) from a prio invocation of the activity

onRestart()
called when the activity is about to restart after having previously been stopped by runtime system

onStart()
always called immediately after the call to the onCreate() or onRestart() methods, this method indicates to the activity that is about to become visible to the user
This call will be followed by a call to onResume() if the activity moves to the top of the activity stack, onStop() in the event that it is pushed down the stack by another activity

onResume()
indicates that the activity is now at the top of acivity stack and is the activity with which the user is currently interacting

onPause()
indicates that a previous activity is about to become the foreground activity. this call will be followed by a call to either the onResume() or onStop()
Steps may be taken within this method to store persistent state infomation not yet saved by the app
to avoid delays in switching between activities, time consuming operations such as storing data to databse pr performing network operations should be avoided within this method
this method should also ensure that any CPU intensive tasks such as anumation are stopped

onStop()
The activity is now no longer visible to the user. the two possible senarios that may follow this call are a call to onRestart() in the vent that the actyivity moves to the foreground again, on Destroy() if the activity is being terminated.

onDestroy()
The activity is about to be destroyed, either voluntarily because has completed its tasks and has called the finish() method or because the runtime is terminating it either to release memory or due to a configuration change (such as the orientation of the device changing)
It's important to note that a call will not always be made to onDestroy() when an activity is terminated


Dynamic State
in addtion to lifecycle methods outlined above, there are two methods intended specifically for saving and restoring the dynamic state of an activity:
--- onRestoreInstanceState(Bundle savedInstanceState)
This method is called immediately after a call to the onStart() method in the vent that theactivity is restarting from a previous invocation in which state was saved
As with onCreate(), this method is passed a Bundle object containing the previous state data
This method is typically used in situations where it makes more sense to restore a previuos state after the initaialization of activity has been performed in the onCreate() and onStart()

The Manifest

Every app project must have an AndroidManifest.xml file (with precisely that name) at the root of the project source set. The manifest file describes essential information about your app to the Android build tools, the Android operating system and Google play
Among many other things, the manifest file is required to declare the following:
<The components of the app> include all activities, services, broadcast receivers and content providers. Each component must define basic properties such as name of its kotlin or Java class. It can also declare cappabilities such as which device configurations it can be handle, and intent filters that describe how the component can be started.
<The permissions> that the app needs in order to access protectetd parts of the system or other apps. it also declares any permissions that other apps must have if they want to access content from this app.
<The hardware and software features> the app requires, which affects which devices can install the app from Google Play.

- App components: for each app component that you create in your app, you must declare a corresponding XML element in the manifest file:
* <activity> for each subclass of Activity
* <service> for each subclass of Service
* <receiver> for each subclass of BroadcastReceiver.
* <provider> for each subclass of ContentProvider
	if you subclass any of these components without declaring it in the manifest file, the system cannot start it. The name of your subclass must be specified with the name attribute, using full package designation.

- Intent filter: App activities, services and broadcast receivers are activated by intents. An intent is a message defined by an intent object that describes an action to perform, including the data to be acted upon, category of component should perform the action, and other instructions. An app component can have any number of intent filters (defined with the <intent-filter> element), each one describing a different capability of that component.

- Icons and lables: several manifest elements have icon and label attributes for displayong a small icon and a text label, respectively, to users for the corresponding app component. In every case, the icon and label that are set in a parent element become the default icon and label value for all child elements. For example, the icon and label value for all child elements. for example, the icon and label that are set in the <application> element that are default icon and label for each of the app's components (such as all activities).

- Permissions: Androi apps must request permission to access sensitive user data (such as contacts and SMS) or certain system features (such as the camera and internet access). Each permission is identified by a uique label. For example, an app that needs to access the internet must have the following line in the manifest:
	android.permission.INTERNET

Gradle Build Files

Gradle build files use a domain-specific language or DSL to define custom build logic and to interact wth the Android-specific elements of the Android plugin for Gradle.
Android Studio projects consiste of one or more modules, which are components that you can build, test, and debug independently. Each module has its own build file, so every Android studio prjoject contains two kinds of Gradle build files.
- Top-Level Build File: this is where you'll find configuration options that are commn to all the modules that make up your projetc.
- Module-Level Build File: Each module has its own Gradle build file that contains module-specific build settings. You'll spend most of your time editing module-level build file(s) rather than your project's top-level build file.
- Gradle-wrapper.properties (Gradle Version): this file allows other people to build your cod, even if they don't hav Gradle installed on their machine. This file checks whether the correct version of Gradle is installed and downloads the necessary version if necessary.

_________________________________________________________________________
App Resources

Resources are the additional files and static content that your code uses, such as bitmaps, layout definitions, user interface strings, animation instructions and more.
You should always externalize app resources such as images and strings from you code, so that you can maintain the independently.
Once you externalize your app resources, you can access them using resource IDs that are generated in your project's R class.
You should place each type of resource in a specific subdirectory of your projetc's res/directory
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adapter

An Adapter object acts as a bridge between an AdapterView and underlying data for that view. The Adapter provides acces to data items.
The Adapter is also responsible for making a view for each item in the data set.

<data source> ----- <Adapter> ------- <AdapterView (listview,...)>
Whenever we want to bind some data which we get from any data source (ArrayList, HashMap, SQLite, etc) with a UI component (e.g. ListView, GridView, etc) then Adapter comes into the picture

Type of Adapter
There are the some commonly used Adapter in Android used to fill the data in the UI components

BaseAdapter - It is parent adapter for all other adapters.
ArrayAdapter - It is used whenever we have a list of single items which is backed by an array
Custom ArrayAdapter - It is used whenever we need to display a custom list
SimpleAdapter - It's an easy adapter to map a static data to views defined in your XML file
Custom SimmpleAdapter - It's used whenever we need to display a customized list and needed t access teh child items of the list or grid

BaseAdapter:
- is a common base class of a general implementation of an Adapter that can be used in ListView, GridView, Spinner etc
- Whenever we need to customized list in a listview or customized grids in a GridView we create our own adapter and extend base adapter in that.
- Base Adapter can be extended to create a custom Adapter for displaying a custom list item. ArrayAdapter is also an implementation of BaseAdapter.

Array Adapter:
- Whenever we have a list of single items which is backed by an Array, we can use ArrayAdapter.
You can use this adapter to provide views for an AdapterView,or returns a view for each object in a collection of data objetcs you provide, and can be used with list-based user interface widgets such as ListView or Spinner
For instance, list of phone contacts, countries or names

Adapter View:
- An AdapterView is a view whose children are determined by an Adapter.
- An AdapterView is a group of widgets in Android that include the ListView, Spinner and GridView. In general, these are the widgets that provide the selecting capability in the user interface

- At a minimum, you will need to implement four methods. These four methods are called by Android to build your AdapterView and to return the correct information when one of the items in the AdapterView is selected.
+ getCount(): indicates to Android how many items(or rows) are in the data setthat will be presented in the AdapterView
+ getItem(int pos): get the data item associated with the item (or row) from the AdapterView passed as paramenter to the method. This method will be used by Android to fetch the approriate data to build the item/row in the AdapterView.
+ getItemId(int pos): this method returns the data set'sid for a item/row position of the AdapterView. Typically, the data set id matches the AdapterView rows so this method just returns the same value.
+ getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent): this method creates the View (which may be a single View component like a TextView or a complex set of widgets in a layout) that displays the data for the specified (by position) item/row in the AdapterView.
